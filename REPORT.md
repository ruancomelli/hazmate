## Executive Summary

This report documents my approach to solving MercadoLibre's hazmat detection challenge. The goal is to build a system that can identify hazardous materials in product listings and explain why certain items need special shipping handling.

I built a classification system using Large Language Models (LLMs) optionally enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system can process product descriptions and determine whether items contain hazardous materials, while providing human-readable explanations for each decision.

**Accomplishments:**

- Successfully collected 100,000 real products from MercadoLibre's API, covering diverse categories that might contain hazmat items. This required overcoming significant technical challenges including OAuth token expiration and API endpoint limitations.

- Implemented a RAG-enhanced classification system that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with a knowledge base of human-labeled examples.

- Achieved 97.3% accuracy on definitive hazmat items (identified through product attributes) without RAG.

- Developed an evaluation strategy using MercadoLibre's own product attributes as ground truth, allowing reliable assessment of model performance without time-consuming manual labeling.

## Approach

### Data Collection

#### Data collection strategy: MercadoLibre's API\*\*

I chose to work with MercadoLibre's public API rather than web scraping for several practical reasons: First, it's much more reliable - APIs give you structured data in a predictable format, whereas web scraping is fragile and breaks whenever the website changes. Second, I'm less likely to get blocked or rate-limited when using official endpoints. Third, this is closer to what a production system would receive as input: well-structured data.

#### OAuth 2.0 authentication

To access the API, I needed to authenticate using OAuth 2.0. The [API documentation](https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/pt_br/autenticacao-e-autorizacao) provided a guide for the authentication process, but I needed to implement a custom solution to handle the token expiration. Due to the expiration time of 5min of each access token, the data collection stage could not be reliably executed in a single run.

To solve this, I obtained a static domain from ngrok and used it to handle the redirect callback. The ngrok domain pointed to a Flask server running locally. Finally, managing the authorization code, access token, and refresh token was performed by adding `requests-oauthlib` as a dependency to the project.

#### The multi-endpoint data fusion approach

During the initial analysis, it became evident that no single API endpoint provided complete information for the data collection requirements. The following endpoints were utilized:

```
/sites/{site_id}/categories           # All categories in the site
/categories/{category_id}             # Category structure
/categories/{category_id}/attributes  # Attribute definitions
/products/search                      # Product discovery (primary functional endpoint)
/products/{product_id}                # Detailed product information
```

The categories endpoints provided access to MercadoLibre's product taxonomy structure. The search endpoint enabled product discovery, albeit through alternative query-based methods rather than the initially planned category-filtered approach. The detailed product endpoint delivered comprehensive descriptions and structured attribute data about the product

#### Data Collection Implementation

The data collection process required navigating several technical challenges and API limitations to successfully gather 100,000 diverse product samples.

**API exploration and taxonomy analysis**

I developed `list_all_subcategories.py` to systematically explore MercadoLibre's category structure and available product attributes. This analysis revealed a comprehensive taxonomy with detailed attribute definitions for each category, confirming the feasibility of building a diverse, well-structured dataset.

**API endpoint limitations**

Initial attempts to use category-filtered search endpoints (`/site/$SITE_ID/items/search?category=$CATEGORY` and `/site/$SITE_ID/items/search?q=$QUERY`) consistently returned 403 Forbidden errors. After extensive testing with different authentication approaches and request parameters, I concluded that these endpoints were likely restricted for the application permissions available, and a different approach was needed.

**Alternative search strategy**

The solution was to use the accessible `/products/search` endpoint, which requires query-based rather than category-based filtering. This necessitated creating targeted search queries to simulate category-specific collection, leading to the development of the `hazmat-collector-config.yaml` configuration file.

I used ChatGPT (https://chatgpt.com/share/685c82d0-05f0-8009-88d4-76a4105c4702) to generate targeted search queries that would capture products from specific categories. For example, instead of filtering by "automotive accessories," I created queries like "Ã³leo automotivo," "fluido de freio," "bateria carro," etc. This approach required Portuguese search terms that would naturally surface products from each target category.

**Category selection strategy**

Category selection focused on areas where hazmat items might realistically appear alongside regular products. I excluded vehicles (different logistics requirements), books/music/films (no hazmat considerations), and services/events (non-physical products).

**Query expansion and optimization**

Initial query generation provided insufficient coverage for the 100,000-item target. I expanded the query list significantly using Cursor assistance, adding more search terms per category and including specific hazmat-focused queries in the `extra_queries` section of the `hazmat-collector-config.yaml` file. The final configuration contains over 800 search terms designed to maximize category coverage.

**OAuth token management challenges**

MercadoLibre's OAuth tokens expire every 5 minutes, creating significant challenges for long-running data collection processes. Initial collection attempts would fail mid-process when tokens expired, requiring the incorporation of automatic token refresh. This became a critical component for successful large-scale data collection.

**Collection strategy trade-offs: balanced vs. speed**

The data collection script implements two distinct strategies addressing different priorities in dataset construction.

The "balanced" approach ensures equal representation across categories, with systematic rotation through categories and queries to prevent any single category from dominating the dataset. Within each category, it maximizes diversity of product families and attributes. This approach optimizes for data quality and representativeness rather than collection speed, ensuring the model receives a comprehensive sample across all product types.

The "speed" approach prioritizes collection efficiency while maintaining reasonable category coverage. It optimizes batching strategies, accepting less strict per-category quotas in favor of faster overall collection.

Implementation of both strategies:

```bash
# Balanced approach for analysis and validation
uv run -m hazmate.input_datasets -o "data/inputs/input_dataset_small.jsonl" --target-size 100 --goal balance

# Speed-optimized approach for full dataset
uv run -m hazmate.input_datasets -o "data/inputs/input_dataset_full.jsonl" --target-size 100_000 --goal speed
```

The balanced small dataset provides precise distribution statistics across categories, families, and attributes, validating that the speed-optimized full dataset maintains adequate balance across the dimensions relevant for hazmat detection.

### Building the Classification System

**Model architecture selection: LLMs vs traditional ML**

The choice between Large Language Models and traditional machine learning approaches represented a key architectural decision with significant implications for system performance and explainability.

Hazmat detection requires sophisticated understanding of complex product descriptions and their relationship to safety regulations. LLMs excel at nuanced text analysis, enabling recognition that "acetone-based nail polish remover" contains flammable materials requiring special handling. Traditional ML approaches would struggle with this level of domain knowledge integration and semantic reasoning.

Explainability requirements strongly favored LLM implementation. The system must provide clear justifications for hazmat classifications to support human review and audit processes. LLMs generate human-readable explanations naturally as part of their output, while traditional ML models would require separate interpretability frameworks.

Here's how the basic agent works:

```python
# Core agent with optional RAG enhancement
agent = HazmatAgent.from_model(
    model_name="openai:gpt-4o-mini",  # Configurable model
    example_store=example_store       # RAG knowledge base
)
```

**The hazmat detection criteria**

I built the system around comprehensive hazmat detection rules based on real shipping regulations. The model looks for several categories of hazards:

Physical hazards like flammable liquids, gases, and solids - things like alcohol, acetone, propane, or matches. Explosive materials including fireworks, ammunition, and reactive chemicals. Corrosive substances like acids and bases that can damage skin or packaging. Compressed gases in pressurized containers.

Health hazards including toxic or poisonous materials, carcinogenic substances, and irritants. This covers everything from pesticides to certain cosmetic ingredients.

Environmental hazards - substances that are harmful to aquatic life or can deplete the ozone layer.

Special categories like radioactive materials (smoke detectors with americium) and infectious substances (certain biological samples).

**Structured output for traceability**

The key insight was that every prediction needed to be traceable and explainable:

```python
class HazmatPrediction(BaseModel):
    item_id: str                    # Links back to the original product
    is_hazmat: bool                # Clear binary decision
    traits: list[HazmatTrait]      # Specific hazards identified
    reason: str                    # Human-readable explanation
```

This structure ensures that every decision can be audited, and the reasoning can be reviewed by human experts.

### The Evaluation Challenge

**Ground truth generation strategy**

Establishing reliable ground truth for hazmat detection presented a significant methodological challenge, as pre-labeled datasets for this domain are not readily available.

The solution leverages MercadoLibre's own product attributes to identify definitive hazmat cases with high confidence. Products with explicit hazmat-indicating attributes provide unambiguous ground truth labels. For example, products marked "Ã inflamÃ¡vel: Sim" (Is flammable: Yes) or "Com mercÃºrio: Sim" (Contains mercury: Yes) represent clear hazmat cases.

```yaml
# hazmat-attributes-config.yaml
hazmat_attributes:
  - name: Ã inflamÃ¡vel
    value: Sim
    tags: [INFLAMABLE]
  - name: Com mercÃºrio
    value: Sim
    tags: [MERCURY]
```

This approach provides high-confidence ground truth labels for a subset of products. While not comprehensiveâhazmat products without explicit attributes existâthe method ensures reliability. Products labeled by MercadoLibre with hazmat-indicating attributes can be considered definitively hazardous.

**Evaluation methodology**

The evaluation process filters the dataset to identify products with definitive hazmat attributes, then applies the classifier to assess performance. Well-functioning models should correctly identify these products as hazmat while providing appropriate explanations.

Key performance metrics include accuracy (percentage of definitive hazmat items correctly identified) and false negative rate (percentage of hazmat items missed). False negatives require particular attention in this domain due to potential safety implications of undetected hazmat products.

Evaluation also includes qualitative assessment of reasoning quality. Effective predictions must not only achieve correct classification but also identify appropriate hazard traits and provide coherent explanations.

### Advanced Techniques Employed

**RAG enhancement architecture**

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation component addresses the gap between general LLM knowledge and domain-specific nuances in MercadoLibre's product catalog. While GPT-4o-mini demonstrates strong understanding of hazmat concepts generally, it benefits from specific examples and edge cases encountered in real product data.

The system implements a knowledge base using ChromaDB and LangChain that stores human-labeled examples of hazmat and non-hazmat products:

```python
# RAG implementation with ChromaDB + LangChain
example_store = ExampleStore.from_embedding_model_name_and_persist_directory(
    embedding_model_name="google:models/gemini-embedding-exp-03-07",
    persist_directory="data/examples"
)

# Retrieve similar examples for context
similar_examples = example_store.retrieve(input_item, count=3)
```

During classification, the system first retrieves similar products from the knowledge base that have been manually labeled by domain experts. The LLM then leverages these concrete examples to inform classification decisions.

For example, when classifying "Removedor de Esmalte Acetona," the system retrieves a previous example of "Acetone Nail Polish Remover" labeled as hazmat due to acetone content. This provides specific context and precedent for the classification decision.

Key benefits include improved accuracy through human expertise integration, enhanced consistency through similar product handling, and simplified knowledge updates through example addition without model retraining.

**Structured Prompting:**

```python
def get_system_prompt(self, include_examples_rag: bool = False) -> str:
    base_prompt = """
    You are a hazardous materials (Hazmat) classification expert...

    Hazardous materials include but are not limited to:
    - Flammable liquids, solids, and gases
    - Explosive materials and fireworks
    - Corrosive substances (acids, bases)
    - Toxic or poisonous materials
    ...
    """

    if include_examples_rag:
        base_prompt += """
        ENHANCED CLASSIFICATION WITH EXAMPLES:
        1. First, use the retrieve_similar_examples tool
        2. Analyze the product considering similar examples
        3. Make classification decision with example references
        """
```

**Embedding Strategy:**

- **Model**: Google Gemini Embedding (task_type="retrieval_document")
- **Content**: Product name + description + classification + reasoning
- **Metadata**: Structured attributes for filtering and analysis

### Hallucination Control Techniques

**Structured Output Validation:**

```python
# Pydantic models ensure valid JSON output
class HazmatPrediction(BaseModel):
    item_id: str = Field(description="Item ID for traceability")
    is_hazmat: bool = Field(description="Binary classification")
    traits: list[HazmatTrait] = Field(description="Specific hazard traits")
    reason: str = Field(description="Justification")
```

**Constrained Generation:**

- **Trait Enumeration**: Predefined hazmat trait categories
- **Reasoning Templates**: Structured justification requirements
- **ID Validation**: Ensure predictions match input items

**Multi-Step Validation:**

```python
# Verify prediction consistency
if input_item.item_id != prediction.item_id:
    raise MismatchedItemIdsError(...)
```

**Confidence Scoring:**

- **RAG Similarity**: Higher confidence when similar examples exist
- **Trait Consistency**: Multiple trait indicators increase confidence
- **Reasoning Coherence**: Length and specificity of justification
